## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

John, you have the receipts — decades of turnaround experience, a proven methodology (*The Art of the Pivot*), and real results. What's missing is the system to showcase this and convert strangers into believers *before* they get on a call.

**This 2-week engagement builds that foundation.**

## THE PROBLEM

| Current Reality | Impact |
|:----------------|:-------|
| No follow-up after form submission | Leads go cold |
| No video explanation | Visitors miss your depth |
| No nurturing before calls | Prospects arrive unprepared |
| No multi-channel touchpoints | Relying on hope |

> *"There's no follow-up to it, and we have to get that whole system automated."* — You

## OUR SOLUTION: Trust-Before-Call System

By the time prospects get on a call, they'll already know who you are, your results, and what to expect.
