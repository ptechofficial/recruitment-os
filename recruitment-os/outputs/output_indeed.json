We are a dream team obsessed with the uncomfortable excitement of discovering what happens when you merge creativity, intuition and cutting-edge technology. Come be a part of what’s next.\n\nWho we are\n\nResilience Engineering’s purpose is to help other teams at Netflix understand the outcome of a change (e.g. a code change), before they are deployed to production.\n\nOur tools help teams build confidence that their services will perform as expected when changes are introduced, while also providing early insights into any unintended consequences, such as increased error rates or latency, that could affect the Netflix experience for our users.\n\nA majority of critical services leverage our platform and tooling to confidently and safely deliver changes to production on a day to day basis.\n\nYou can learn more about what we do from the Evolution of Chaos presentation.\n\nWhere we work\n\nWe are a distributed team, with members working both remotely and near Netflix offices. We collaborate asynchronously and meet in person quarterly.\n\nWhat you could work on\n\nWe have two major focuses that you could work on in 2026:\n\nExpand our canary approach to new use cases, including libraries and functions.\n\nIncrease confidence that Netflix’s most critical applications are resilient under different expected and unexpected conditions.\n\nSome of the larger initiatives we will be focusing on are:\n\nExtending canaries to effectively support use cases where a single change needs to be validated across a large number of targets (e.g. library changes).\n\nExpanding canary support to new resource types, like functions.\n\nScaling out chaos testing to recurrently validate fallback behaviour on behalf of application owners.\n\nAbout you\n\nYou are curious and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems.\n\nYou collaborate effectively across teams, using communication skills to influence product direction.\n\nYou are product-focused, driving the ideation, design, development, and implementation to turn user’s pain-points into simple and elegant solutions.\n\nYou have experience to distributed systems including how to debug them and how they can fail.\n\nGenerally, our compensation structure consists solely of an annual salary; we do not have bonuses. You choose each year how much of your compensation you want in salary versus stock options. To determine your personal top of market compensation, we rely on market indicators and consider your specific job family, background, skills, and experience to determine your compensation in the market range. The range for this role is $250,000.00 - $413,000.00. This compensation range will vary based on location.\n\nNetflix provides comprehensive benefits including Health Plans, Mental Health support, a 401(k) Retirement Plan with employer match, Stock Option Program, Disability Programs, Health Savings and Flexible Spending Accounts, Family-forming benefits, and Life and Serious Injury Benefits.
