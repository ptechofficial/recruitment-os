This ends up in gaming of the system - instead of actually getting the behavior you're trying to measure. Whether the data points are headcount, revenue per employee, or utilization - we should be measuring outputs on a long-term basis, and not quarterly or sometimes even yearly. Managers know who is doing well and who is slacking, but many decisions are made by KPI numbers instead of human managers.",
